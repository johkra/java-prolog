# java-prolog

This project aims to create a simple Prolog implementation in Java. It's only for educational purposes, because I want to improve my understanding of both Java and Prolog for an upcoming internship.

Please use an established Prolog implementation if you want to use Prolog, but feel free to dig through the code, if you, too, want to learn more about Prolog.
